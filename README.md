# Connect-4-Game
;Programmer: Pravesh Jung Karki 
;Description: Connect 4 is played on a grid of 6 rows by 7 columns.
;Two players alternate placing markers on the grid.
;Each player is assigned a unique shape or color (like black or red) to distinguish their markers.
;Each turn consists of inserting a marker in one of the (unfilled) columns,
;which causes the next empty row in that column, starting from the bottom row, to receive that marker.
;In other words, each entry adds one more marker to the stack of markers inthe designated column.
;The object of the game is to be the first player to "connect four"
;adjacent markers of the same shape or color, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
